# HTML5-server-sent-event
A server-sent event is when a web page automatically gets updates from a server.  This was also possible before, but the web page would have to ask if any updates were available. With server-sent events, the updates come automatically.  Examples: Facebook/Twitter updates, stock price updates, news feeds, sport results, etc.
